# fjet-website
Welcome to the repository for the new FJET website.

This site is intended to be lightweight and mobile-first, consisting mostly of only HTML and CSS, with some
Bootstrap 4 and some JavaScript. 

This repository is intended to be a living repository so that the site can be update as needed by the 
FJET council.

Please email any questions to the current webmaster, Seth Christmus, at fjetwebmaster@gmail.com.
